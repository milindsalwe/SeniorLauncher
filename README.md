# SeniorLauncher
A launcher app for Android, intended for oldies

<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=de.nodomain.tobihille.seniorlauncher"><img src="https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="100"></a>

## What does this app do?
* It registers as app launcher (that means it is called when the phone boots and the home button is pressed).
* It let's the user decide if he wants to call someone or wants to watch images
* It reads the contact list and displays all contacts that have an image and a phone number (only the first number is used!).
* Every contact is displayed as a large button with the contact's image on it.
* On click either a call to the contact is initialized or the sms-app is opened to show images sent via mms
* In image-mode the gallery can be opened
* Calling the ambulance is added on top of the list in the call-screen.
* Language: US english, german, french and brazilian portugese. (the medical emergency number is localized, of course)

## Why are mms used for images?
* Because they are available everywhere and every phone has an app to use them installed
* Because it is the only way (i found out) to carry the user right to the newest images

## Any suggestions
* I'd recommend to use QKSMS as an SMS/MMS - app because this copies all images automatically to the gallery and because it's free (https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms)
